This repo stores a demo about parametric surfaces, surfaces of revolution, and (soon) spline curves.  It also demonstrates how to combine shapes in tiny-graphics.js, and how to animate them with moving points.

The relevant code is all in surfaces-demo.js.  The other example files are included here for completeness sake only.
